# PokeList

- I used the VIPER architecture, a well-uncoupled architecture with well-defined classes.
- The Views were created with ViewCode because I believe it has a better efficiency in large projects.
- I didn't use third-party libraries to showcase my native knowledge.
- I used dependency injections to decouple code.
- Use of protocols to facilitate communication between classes.
- An extra button was created to go up the pokemon list.
- Asynchronous image loading.
- The pagination of the pokemons was done, loading from 20 to 20 so as not to delay the loading of the list.
- I created a cell to show pagination loading.
- It was done over a weekend.
